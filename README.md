# gorank.ca

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
I have used [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) as my cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service.

Personal website created using React containing projects, blogs, and contact info available at https://gorank.ca.

- `npm start` runs the server in app in development mode.
- `npm run deploy` deploys the app to production.
